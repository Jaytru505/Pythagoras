# Pythagoras
## Advanced Python tools for Data Scientists

### Main Use Cases

1. ***Improve accuracy*** of your predictions by employing highly-efficient regression model
2. ***Speed up*** your Data Science code by adding persistent file-based caching 
3. Make your scripts and classes ***easy to debug and reuse*** by equipping them with story-telling capabilities
4. Fully ***automate*** your ***data cleaning and feature engineering*** processes (COMING SOON)

### What Do The Name And Logo Mean?

Pythagoras was a famous ancient Greek thinker and scientist 
who was the first man to call himself a philosopher ("lover of wisdom"). 
He is most recognised for his many mathematical findings, 
including the Pythagorean theorem. 

But not everyone knows that in antiquity, Pythagoras was also credited with major astronomical discoveries,
such as sphericity of the Earth and the identity of the morning and evening stars as the planet Venus. 
Our logo depicts these, lesser known but not less important achievements of Pythagoras.
