# Pythagoras
## Advanced Python tools for Data Scientists

### Main Use Cases

1. **Speed up** your Data Science code by employing persistent file-based cashing 
2. Make your scripts and classes **easy to debug and reuse** by equipping them with story-telling capabilities
3. Fully **automate** your **feature engineering** process and free your time (*COMING SOON*)
4. **Improve accuracy** of your predictions by creating **best-in-class regression models** (*COMING SOON*)

### Major Components

* **PickleCache**: Pandas-compatible persistent caching, effortlessly extendable to work with new custom classes

* **LoggableObject**: Simple base class that provides your objects with easy-to-use story-telling tools

* **DeterministicGarden**: State-of-the-art regression algorithm that outperforms popular ones (*COMING SOON*)

* **FeatureShower**: Automatic feature generator (*COMING SOON*) 

### Tutorials

1. Basic Cashing: How to speed up your code using PickleCache if your Python code works with Pandas and build-in datatypes
2. Advanced Caching: How to make PickleCache work with custom classes 
 
### Core design principles 

1. Transparency and explainability
2. Pandas as the main data vessel
3. OOP and static typing 
4. SKLearn-like interfaces when possible
