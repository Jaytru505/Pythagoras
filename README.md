# Pythagoras
## Advanced Python tools for Data Scientists

### Main Use Cases

1. ***Speed up*** your Data Science code by employing persistent file-based cashing 
2. Make your scripts and classes ***easy to debug and reuse*** by equipping them with story-telling capabilities
3. Fully ***automate*** your ***feature engineering*** process and free your time (COMING SOON)
4. ***Improve accuracy*** of your predictions by creating ***best-in-class regression models*** (COMING SOON)

### Major Components

* **PickleCache**: Pandas-compatible persistent caching, effortlessly extendable to work with new custom classes

* **LoggableObject**: Simple base class that provides your objects with easy-to-use story-telling tools

* **DeterministicGarden**: State-of-the-art regression algorithm that outperforms popular ones (COMING SOON)

* **FeatureShower**: Automatic feature generator (COMING SOON)
