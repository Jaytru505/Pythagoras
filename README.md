# Pythagoras
## Advanced Python tools for Data Scientists

### Main Use Cases

1. **Speed up** your Data Science code by employing persistent file-based cashing 
2. Make your scripts and classes **easy to reuse** by equipping them with story-telling capabilities
3. **Improve accuracy** of your predictions by creating **best-in-class** regression models (*COMING SOON*)
4. Fully **automate** your **feature engineering** process (*COMING SOON*)

### Major Classes

* **PickleCache**: Pandas-compatible persistent caching, effortlessly extendable to work with new custom classes

* **LoggableObject**: Simple base class that provides your objects with easy-to-use story-telling tools

* **DeterministicGarden**: State-of-the-art regression algorithm that outperforms popular ones (*COMING SOON*)

* **FeatureShower**: Automatic feature generator (*COMING SOON*) 

### Tutorials
